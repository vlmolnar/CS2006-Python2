# refine the dataset:
# - develop a procedure to check that the data match expected format and remove duplicates
# – in case of any inconsistencies and/or duplicates found, produce new file with refined data
#   to be used in the subsequent analysis
# – this step must be automated and documented in case one may need to re-run it, although it’s
#   not necessary to repeat it each time while re-running the analysis
